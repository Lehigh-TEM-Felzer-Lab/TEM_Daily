The Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM)

The Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) is a process-based ecosystem model that describes carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics of plants and soils for terrestrial ecosystems of the globe. The TEM uses spatially referenced information on climate, elevation, soils and vegetation as well as soil- and vegetation-specific parameters to make estimates of important carbon, nitrogen and water fluxes and pool sizes of terrestrial ecosystems. The TEM normally operates on a monthly time step and at a 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude spatial resolution, but the model has been applied at finer spatial resolutions (down to 1 hectare).

This Model has to be compiled using a C++ compiler.
